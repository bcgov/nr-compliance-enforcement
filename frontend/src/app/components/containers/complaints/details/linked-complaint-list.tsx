      "On Mar 30, 2023 at 1245 hrs I observed Lean Bean Miller's truck (see photo) hauling a load of poultry slaughter waste along Doran Rd heading north to Hillbank Rd. I have followed this truck in past from the Island Farmhouse Poultry facility to 4035 Hillbank Road and can attest that this is the route this truck takes to dump its loads of slaughter waste. Last month both Island Farmhouse Poultry Ltd. and GT Farms were told by the Ministry to 'Immediately cease disposing of any processing waste that comes from poultry not reared, kept or slaughtered at Miller properties.' The most recent Ministry Inspection reports, UA202814 and AG144737, both stated that this unauthorized waste disposal must be ceased immediately. Its time for the Ministry to involve the Conservation Officer Service and to start taking regulations enforcement seriously. ",
